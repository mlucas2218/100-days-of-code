# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: Monday, January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed FreeCodeCamp exercises on JSON APIs and Ajax.  Revisited the "local weather" page I made several months ago to try to add functionality to show the user's local time.  Still needs some work in order to function correctly.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to dedicate time to a project and learn new things.  I definitely didn't really understand the details of JSON/APIs when I rushed through those FreeCodeCamp exercises earlier this year.  I hope to practice working with APIs a lot more.
