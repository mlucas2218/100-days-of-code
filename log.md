# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: Monday, January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 40 minutes.  Reviewed FreeCodeCamp exercises on JSON APIs and Ajax.  Revisited the "local weather" page I made several months ago to try to add functionality to show the user's local time.  Still needs some work in order to function correctly.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to dedicate time to a project and learn new things.  I definitely didn't really understand the details of JSON/APIs when I rushed through those FreeCodeCamp exercises earlier this year.  I hope to practice working with APIs a lot more.

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 40 minutes.  Explored basic transition functionality of [Naughty or Nice Toggle](https://codepen.io/beeg/pen/eydweX) example on CodePen.  Added basic slider to my Local Weather practice page, though it does not yet slide correctly.

**Thoughts:** There are so many different features to explore and experiment with!  I hope I can focus on learning several in depth to really remember what I learn.  40 minutes of coding per day goes by faster than expected when trying to solve a "mystery" or fix something that doesn't work (yet).
